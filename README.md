# Face Detection in Image using OpenCV
This small project shows the working of OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library), an open source computer vision and machine learning software library for detecting faces in an image.
#
## Prerequisites:
- **Python3**
```
$ sudo apt-get install python3
$ sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```
- **OpenCV**
```
$ sudo pip3 install opencv-python
```
- [**OpenCV Haarcascades Data**](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades)
#
## Steps to run the code:
- Just replace the path of image and run the **detector.py** file.

**The following shows the output of this code:**<br>
